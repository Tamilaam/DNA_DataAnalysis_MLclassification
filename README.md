# DNA AFM Analysis and Classification
### Master's Degree in Quantitative Biology  
**University of Milan**  
**This Analysis has been done as a part of the course "Measurement of nanoscale interactions in biological systems and data analysis"**

This project analyzes atomic force microscopy (AFM) data of DNA molecules to estimate the rise per residue (rpr) based on contour length measurements. It also includes a machine learning model to classify DNA samples by contour length. 

## Methods
- Histogram analysis and Gaussian fitting
- Linear regression with error propagation
- Compatibility test with B-form DNA (rpr = 0.34 nm)
- Double-weighted regression accounting for base pair error
- KNN classification based on contour length
